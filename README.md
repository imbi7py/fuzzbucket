# fuzzbucket

The `fuzzbucket` API and `fuzzbucket-client` command line tool are intended to
work together to provide humans with a simplified means to perform the
following operations on ephemeral EC2 instances ("boxes") in a managed VPC:

-    list
-    create
-    reboot
-    delete

Additionally, there is a periodic function that will terminate stale boxes.

## is this for me?

Maybe.

If you are comfortable with direct access to EC2 via AWS authz for the purpose
of managing instances launched from arbitrary AMIs, then `fuzzbucket` is
probably not what you need.

If you need your EC2 instances to be running for more than a few hours/days by
default, then `fuzzbucket` is probably not what you need.

## development

Prerequisites for development are:

-    `make`
-    `npm`
-    `pipenv`

Hopefully `make` is already available :grimacing:. The `npm` tool should be
present if there is a `node` installation present. The `pipenv` tool may be
installed via `pip`.

Once these prerequisites are available, the default workflow is nearly
identical to what is captured in the [github
workflow](./.github/workflows/main.yml):

```bash
make deps

# BEGIN editing, linting, testing loop {

# edit edit edit
make lint
make test

# } END editing, linting, testing loop
```

## deployment

Deploying the `fuzzbucket` API requires AWS credentials with rights to
create all of the resources managed by the `serverless` framework and
additional resources defined in the [serverless config](./serverless.yml).

The `make deploy` target will run the necessary `serverless` command to create
the whole shebang.

```bash
# deploy to STAGE=dev in REGION=us-east-1
make deploy
```

```bash
# deploy to STAGE=prod in REGION=us-west-2
make deploy STAGE=prod REGION=us-west-2
```

## usage

Once the `fuzzbucket` API is deployed, the `fuzzbucket-client` may be used to
do all the things:

```bash
# install fuzzbucket-client via setup.py
python setup.py install
```

```bash
# get some help
fuzzbucket-client --help
```

As described in this help text, the client tool requires configuration of the
API URL and credentials, which are printed at the end of deployment and also
available via the `serverless`/`sls` tool:

```bash
# show info for STAGE=prod
npx sls info --stage prod
```

For example, if the output of `sls info` were to include values of:

```
...
api keys:
  githubperson01: fafaeaeadadacacababaaaaa
  ...
endpoints:
  GET - https://babacaca9000.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
  ...
```

then the necessary environment variable configuration would be:

```bash
FUZZBUCKET_URL=https://babacaca9000.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
FUZZBUCKET_CREDENTIALS=githubperson01:fafaeaeadadacacababaaaaa
```

Exactly how you choose to manage these environment variables is up to you, but
the default development workflow which uses `pipenv` will automatically source
variables defined in `./.env`. See [the example env](./.example.env) for an
example... env.
